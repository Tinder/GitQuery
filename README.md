GitQuery
==========
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Tinder/GitQuery.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Tinder/GitQuery)

Fast and incremental query and sync of files in a remote git repository.

 - Core library (Kotlin)
 - Command line interface
 - Gradle plugin

An alternative approach for defining dependencies in a build project vs importing of pre-built and published artifacts. 

#### Use cases: 
It is sometimes preferable to query individual files in a remote repo when:
 - we only need a few files from large remote monorepo.
 - we need granular versioning for each dependency file.
 - it is hard to globally version the files in the remote repo, or it would require many artifacts to be published.
 - we want to combine the source files of an artifact into our module.
 - we want to avoid version conflicts as possible when including pre-build artifacts. 

#### Sample gitquery.yml

```yaml
# Describe a set of files to fetch from a given repository.
---
schema:
  version: 1
# remote - The remote repository to query files from.
remote: https://github.com/aminghadersohi/ProtoExample.git
# branch - The single branch that will be cloned on first run and pulled incrementally on
# subsequent runs. The sha values used in [commits] and [files] must be available under [branch].
branch: master
# A list of commit aliases that can be used in the [files] section.
commits:
  latest: d654b510d2689e8ee56d23d03dff2be742737f86
# Specify a nested map of filenames to sha (or commit alias) included file that we
# want to query and sync. The structure of [files] matches the directory structure of the
# remote repo. A key whose value is a nested map is considered a directory.
files:
  # A file at the root fo the remote repo.
  README.md: latest
  # A directory at the root of the remote repo.
  definitions:
    # A file inside the definitions folder.
    user.proto: 42933446d0321958e8c12216d04b9f0c382ebf1b
# A directory to sync the queried files into. default: gitquery-output
outputDir: gitquery-output
# A directory to hold the intermediate cloned git repo. default: /tmp/gitquery/repo
repoDir: /tmp/.gitquery
# If true [default], cleans out the output folder prior to running sync.
cleanOutput: true
# A free form map of String -> Any - enabling self contained integration with various systems.
extra:
  attr1: value1
  attr2: 1
```

#### Gradle Plugin - (https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.tinder.gitquery)
`module/build.gradle:`
```groovy
plugins {
  id "com.tinder.gitquery" version "2.0.1"
}

gitQuery {
    configFile =  "gitquery.yml"
    outputDir =  "gitquery-output"
    repoDir = "remote"
    cleanOutput = true
    verbose = false
}
```

This adds a task called `gitQuery` to the module. It can be executed like so:

```
./gradlew :module:gitQuery
```

#### Command line interface 
Install using brew (https://github.com/Tinder/homebrew-tap):
```
brew tap Tinder/tap 
brew install gitquery
```
or
```
brew install Tinder/tap/gitquery
```

If you need Java 1.8:
```
brew cask install homebrew/cask-versions/adoptopenjdk8 
```

To install from source:
```shell script
./install
``` 

To run 
```shell script
gitquery
``` 

#### Sample Sync 
```shell script
./gitquery --config-file=./samples/sample1.yml --repo-dir=./build/tmp/repo --output-dir=./gitquery-output
```

#### Sample Init - create config that doesn't exist, by default a nested structure generated.
```shell script
./gitquery --init-config \
           --config-file samples/sample1-generate-nested.yml \
           --include-globs **/src/google/protobuf/**/*.proto,**/benchmarks/**/*.proto,README.md,benchmarks/Makefile.am \
           --exclude-globs **/ruby/**,**/proto2/** \
           --remote git@github.com:protocolbuffers/protobuf.git \
           --branch master \
           --sha 012fe854acc5b2a23bf4bef4a3c0b634c65c058e
```

#### Sample Update - by default a nested structure generated.
```shell script
./gitquery --init-config \
           --config-file samples/sample2-generate-nested.yml \
           --include-globs **/src/google/protobuf/**/*.proto,**/benchmarks/**/*.proto \
           --exclude-globs **/ruby/**,**/proto2/**
```

#### Sample Update - flat file structure generated using --flat-files.
```shell script
./gitquery --init-config \
           --config-file samples/sample2-generate-flat.yml --flat-files \
           --include-globs **/src/google/protobuf/**/*.proto,**/benchmarks/**/*.proto \
           --exclude-globs **/ruby/**,**/proto2/**
```

```shell script
./gitquery --help

   --remote TEXT         Remote Git repo url. If provided, this will override
                         any value specified for [remote] in the [configFile].

                         [configFile] default: false
   --init-config         Initialize/update the config file based on command
                         line params. Use --include-globs and --exclude-globs.
                         If [configFile] exists, it will be updated, else it
                         will be created with values from command line or
                         internal defaults. default: false

                         the files attribute in [configFile]. If provided, this
                         comma, space or pipe separated list of globs will
                         override [includeGlobs] in [configFile] and used when
                         initializing/updating the config's [files] map.
   --exclude-globs TEXT  A list of globs to exclude when generating/updating
                         the files attribute in [configFile]. If provided, this

   --flat-files          When --generate-globs is used, this option helps
                         choose if the files in the generated config file
                         should be in a flat map or a nest map. default: false
   --sha TEXT            A sha to use when --init-config is used, if not

#### Example Use Case - Code Generation
We have a tech stack with many mobile/web apps and services with many developers actively working on them. We want to avoid duplicating and handwriting our models and service interfaces, so we decide to store definitions of models and service interfaces in a central idl repo. 

We can choose to build a single artifact for each language that we support in our tech stack or even build many of them. However, since each of our apps or services just needs a couple of files from the idl repo. We can avoid including unneccesary files, in pre-built artifacts, by using GitQuery to pull and sync the idl files that we want. This allows them to be staged for our build. From there we can use our code generation tools, the sames ones we were using to generate code and build them in to an artifact, to generate code from the idl definitions that we care about and use the generated code in our project as any other source code.
