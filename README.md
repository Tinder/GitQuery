com.tinder.gitquery - GitQuery
==========

Fast and incremental query and sync of files in a remote git repository.

 - Core library (Kotlin)
 - Command line interface
 - Gradle plugin

An alternative approach for defining dependencies in a build project vs importing of pre-built and published artifacts. 

#### Use cases: 
It is sometimes preferable to query individual files in a remote repo when:
 - we only need a small number of files from (very) large remote (mono)repo.
 - we need granular versioning for each dependency file.
 - it is hard to globally version the files in the remote repo and it would require many artifacts to be published .
 - we want to combine the source files of an artifact into our module.
 - we want to avoid version conflicts as possible when including pre-build artifacts. 

#### Sample config.yaml

```yaml
# Describe a set of files to fetch from a given repository.
---
schema:
  version: 1
# remote - a remote repository to fetch files from
remote: https://github.com/aminghadersohi/ProtoExample.git
# branch - only this branch will be cloned/pulled, there the sha values below must be in master
branch: master
# Indicate the sha (in remote/branch) for each proto file that we want to have models generated for.
# The structure of the definitions matches the directory structure of the remote repo.
definitions:
  README.md: d654b510d2689e8ee56d23d03dff2be742737f86
  definitions:
    user.proto: 42933446d0321958e8c12216d04b9f0c382ebf1b
```

#### Sample module/build.gradle:

```groovy
plugins {
  id 'com.tinder.gitquery'
}

gitQuery {
    configFile =  "config.yml"
    outputDir =  "synced-src"
    repoDir = "remote"
}
```

#### Command line interface 
To run
```shell script
./gitquery
``` 

#### Sample CLI
```shell script
./gitquery --config-file=./samples/sample2.yaml --repo-dir=./build/tmp/repo --output-dir=./synced-src
```

```shell script
./gitquery --help   
                                                               
Usage: cli [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --config-file TEXT  a yaml file that describe a set of files to fetch/sync
                      from a given repository
  --output-dir TEXT   path to a directory where the files should be synced to
  --repo-dir TEXT     where the remote repo(s) can be cloned locally and
                      stored
  -h, --help          Show this message and exit
```

#### Example Use Case - Code Generation
We have a tech stack with many mobile/web apps and services with many developers actively working on them. We want to avoid duplicating and handwriting our models and service interfaces, so we decide to store definitions of models and service interfaces in a central idl repo. 

We can choose to build a single artifact for each language that we support in our tech stack or even build many of them. However, since each of our apps or services just needs a couple of files from the idl repo. We can avoid including unneccesary files, in pre-built artifacts, by using GitQuery to pull and sync the idl files that we want. This allows them to be staged for our build. From there we can use our code generation tools, the sames ones we were using to generate code and build them in to an artifact, to generate code from the idl definitions that we care about and use the generated code in our project as any other source code.
