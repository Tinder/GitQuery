com.tinder.gitquery - GitQuery
==========

A core library, command line interface, and incremental Gradle plugin, that given a config file, syncs files 
from a git repo to a given directory. The git repo is cached to provide ultra fast subsequent/incremental builds. 

This enables a new approach for querying dependencies across repos as an alternative to the traditional  
pre-built and published artifacts. 

It is sometimes preferable to query individual files in a remote repo when:
 - we only need a small number of files from (very) large remote (mono)repo.
 - we need granular versioning for each dependency file.
 - it is hard to globally version the files in the remote repo and it would require many artifacts to be published .
 - we want to combine the source files of an artifact into our module.
 - we want to avoid version conflicts as possible when including pre-build artifacts. 

#### Sample config.yaml

```yaml
# Describe a set of files to fetch from a given repository.
---
schema:
  version: 1
# remote - a remote repository to fetch Protobuf definitions from
remote: https://github.com/cdsap/ProtoExample.git
# branch - only this branch will be cloned/pulled, there the sha values below must be in 
# master
branch: master
# Indicate the sha (in remote/branch) for each proto file that we want to have models generated for.
# The structure of the definitions matches the directory structure of the remote repo.
definitions:
  # the root directory in the repo
  definitions:
    user.proto: 42933446d0321958e8c12216d04b9f0c382ebf1b
```

#### Sample module/build.gradle:

```groovy
plugins {
  id 'com.tinder.gitquery'
}

gitQuery {
    configFile =  "config.yml"
    outputDir =  "synced-src"
    repoDir = "remote"
}
```

#### Command line interface 
To run
```shell script
./gitquery
``` 

#### Sample CLI
```shell script
./gitquery --config-file=./samples/sample1.yaml --repo-dir=./build/tmp/repo --output-dir=./synced-src
```

```shell script
./gitquery --help   
                                                               
Usage: cli [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --config-file TEXT  a yaml file that describe a set of files to fetch/sync
                      from a given repository
  --output-dir TEXT   path to a directory where the files should be synced to
  --repo-dir TEXT     where the remote repo(s) can be cloned locally and
                      stored
  -h, --help          Show this message and exit
```
